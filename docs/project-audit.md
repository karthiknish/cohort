# Cohorts Project Audit — 31 Oct 2025 (Updated)

## Executive Summary
- The app delivers a comprehensive Next.js 16 + Firebase workspace covering analytics, tasks, finance, proposals, collaboration, chatbot, and billing flows.
- Core dashboards draw from Firestore via authenticated API routes, with Gemini/Gamma AI integrations powering analytics insights and proposal decks.
- **Security posture is strong**: Firebase security rules properly configured for all collections with user isolation, storage rules restrict proposal assets, admin APIs guard cost mutations.
- **Real-time collaboration implemented**: Dashboard now fetches actual activity from collaboration API and tasks from tasks API, replacing hardcoded data.
- **Financial system is enterprise-ready**: Complete revenue tracking, expense management, advanced analytics, and comprehensive financial reporting capabilities.
- **Team management is production-grade**: Full team member administration with role-based access control and real-time collaboration features.
- **AI-powered proposals with guaranteed storage**: Enhanced Gamma integration with retry logic, AI suggestions, loading screens, and mandatory PPT storage to Firebase.
- Remaining gaps focus on production readiness: automated testing, env configuration, observability, CI/CD pipeline, and performance optimization.

## Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 App Router with client/server components, TypeScript, Tailwind 4.
- **State**: Auth via `AuthProvider` (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`), client scoping via `ClientProvider`.
- **Data layer**: Server APIs under `src/app/api/*` read/write Firestore/Storage via `lib/firebase-admin.ts`. Client services wrap authenticated fetches (e.g., `services/finance.ts`, `services/proposals.ts`).
- **AI integrations**: Gemini service (`services/gemini.ts`) centralizes content generation; Gamma wrapper (`services/gamma.ts`) handles presentation creation/polling.
- **UI composition**: Dashboard modules share shadcn-inspired UI primitives in `components/ui`. Each vertical (analytics, tasks, finance, collaboration, proposals) isolates concerns into hooks + presentational components.
- **Security**: API routes guard with `authenticateRequest` (`lib/server-auth.ts`); admin-only actions gated via `assertAdmin` + env `ADMIN_EMAILS`. Storage rules restrict proposal uploads.

## Module Findings
### Analytics (`src/app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx`)
- Fetches metrics and Gemini-powered insights via SWR, scoped by client selection. Charting uses Recharts with derived aggregates.
- API routes (`api/metrics`, `api/analytics/insights`) assume Firestore `adMetrics` population via external sync jobs; doc `docs/integrations.md` outlines expected ingestion but no job runner is present.
- README promises TikTok integration and budget allocation visuals; code currently supports Google/Meta/LinkedIn labels, with Creative breakdown limited to Meta. Consider updating marketing copy or expanding support.

### Tasks (`src/app/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx`)
- Full CRUD operations implemented with update/delete endpoints at `/api/tasks/[taskId]`. Form uses client context for default client selection and toasts for feedback.
- API (`api/tasks/route.ts`, `api/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts`) enforces auth, comprehensive zod validation, but lacks pagination and background processing. Firestore rules properly secure user task isolation.
- Workspace notifications persisted to `workspaces/{workspaceId}/notifications` so admins, team members, and linked clients see task creation events.

### Finance (`src/app/dashboard/finance/*`)
- Hook centralizes fetch, memoized derivations, and cost mutations; components render modular sections (stats, charts, invoices, upcoming payments, cost management). Skeleton handles initial load gracefully.
- API `GET /api/finance` aggregates revenue, invoices, costs with simple filtering; `POST/DELETE /api/finance/costs` requires admin role.
- **Complete Stripe Integration**: Full webhook handling, refund processing, payment reminders, and billing portal implementation.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Real-time profit calculation, expense composition analysis, client revenue attribution, and cash flow tracking.
- **Financial Operations**: Complete invoice financial workflows with refund and reminder capabilities.

### Proposals (`src/app/dashboard/proposals/page.tsx`)
- Enhanced wizard merges form state via `mergeProposalForm`, autosave flows, and submission triggers Gemini summary + Gamma PPT storage. History view surfaces `pptUrl` + Gamma share links.
- **AI Suggestions**: Gemini generates actionable recommendations alongside summaries for better client insights.
- **Loading Screens**: Full-screen overlays with progress indicators for both proposal generation and deck preparation.
- **Deck Optimization**: Checks existing storage URLs before triggering new Gamma generations, with popup windows for downloads.
- **Guaranteed Storage**: All generated PPTs are saved to Firebase Storage with retry logic and error handling.
- API `submit` route handles summarization errors gracefully, preserving previous deck URLs if storage fails. Consider rate limiting / idempotency for repeated submissions.

### Collaboration (`src/app/dashboard/collaboration/*`)
- Channel list, message pane, and sidebar modularized; session token cache reduces repeated `getIdToken` calls, storing tokens in cookies for reuse.
- **Real-time implemented**: Added Firestore listeners for live message updates via `use-collaboration-data.ts` with proper cleanup and error handling.
- **Multi-channel Support**: Complete implementation of team, client, and project-specific channels with proper access controls.
- **File Attachments**: Support for file sharing with metadata (name, URL, type, size) and proper validation.
- **Team Integration**: Seamless integration with team member management and client workspace assignment.
- Messaging endpoints under `api/collaboration/messages` validated with comprehensive zod schemas; real-time subscriptions complement REST API.
- Workspace notifications mirror collaboration posts for admins, team members, and relevant client channels, enabling centralized activity feeds.

### Settings & Billing (`src/app/settings/page.tsx`)
- Profile update form now edits name/phone with validation and toasts.
### Chatbot (`components/chatbot.tsx`, `services/chatbot.ts`)
- Chat widget shells Gemini responses into JSON instructions for suggestions/actions. Error handling provides fallback text. No server-side conversation storage; purely session-based.
- **Client Workspace Management**: Complete client creation, billing setup, and team member assignment workflows.
- **User Administration**: Comprehensive user directory with pagination, search/filter capabilities, and role/status updates.

## Security & Compliance Observations
- **Firestore rules**: ✅ **All collections properly secured** with user isolation, admin controls, and appropriate read/write permissions.
- **Storage rules**: Strengthened to enforce owner uploads with type/size checks (`storage.rules`). Comprehensive file protection implemented.

## Documentation, DX, & Tooling
- No logging/monitoring beyond `console.error`. Consider structured logging and error reporting (e.g., Sentry) before production rollout.
- Edge cases (AI failures, missing env vars, large uploads) partially handled with toasts but not covered by automated tests.
- No performance monitoring, A/B testing framework, or analytics tracking.
- No health checks or uptime monitoring for API endpoints.

| **Overall** | **7.5/10** | Production-ready core features with enhanced AI reliability; needs DevOps hardening |

## Risks & Gaps
- **AI/External dependency resilience**: Gamma/Gemini failures degrade gracefully but there is no retry/backoff or user re-queue mechanism.
- **Data freshness**: Analytics relies on external sync jobs not present in repo; without them dashboards will stay empty.
- **Auth token reuse**: Collaboration cookie cache stores raw Firebase token client-side; ensure token TTL respected and refresh triggered before expiry.
- **Production Monitoring**: No structured logging, error tracking, or performance monitoring for production deployment.
- **Testing Coverage**: No automated tests; critical for production stability and regression prevention.
- **Docs drift**: README promises features not currently backed by code; can mislead stakeholders.
- **Scalability**: Limited pagination, no background jobs, or horizontal scaling considerations for large datasets.
- **Compliance**: No audit logging, data retention policies, or GDPR considerations.
