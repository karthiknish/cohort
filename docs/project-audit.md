## Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 App Router with client/server components, TypeScript, Tailwind 4.
- **State**: Auth via `AuthProvider` (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`), client scoping via `ClientProvider`.
- **Data layer**: Server APIs under `src/app/api/*` read/write Firestore/Storage via `lib/firebase-admin.ts`. Client services wrap authenticated fetches (e.g., `services/finance.ts`, `services/proposals.ts`).
- **AI integrations**: Gemini service (`services/gemini.ts`) centralizes content generation; Gamma wrapper (`services/gamma.ts`) handles presentation creation/polling.
- **UI composition**: Dashboard modules share shadcn-inspired UI primitives in `components/ui`. Each vertical (analytics, tasks, finance, collaboration, proposals) isolates concerns into hooks + presentational components.
- **Security**: API routes guard with `authenticateRequest` (`lib/server-auth.ts`); admin-only actions gated via `assertAdmin` + env `ADMIN_EMAILS`. Storage rules restrict proposal uploads.

## Module Findings
### Analytics (`src/app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx`)
- Fetches metrics and Gemini-powered insights via SWR, scoped by client selection. Charting uses Recharts with derived aggregates.
- API routes (`api/metrics`, `api/analytics/insights`) assume Firestore `adMetrics` population via external sync jobs; doc `docs/integrations.md` outlines expected ingestion but no job runner is present.
- README promises TikTok integration and budget allocation visuals; code currently supports Google/Meta/LinkedIn labels, with Creative breakdown limited to Meta. Consider updating marketing copy or expanding support.

### Tasks (`src/app/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx`)
- Full CRUD operations implemented with update/delete endpoints at `/api/tasks/[taskId]`. Form uses client context for default client selection and toasts for feedback.
- API (`api/tasks/route.ts`, `api/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts`) enforces auth, comprehensive zod validation, but lacks pagination and background processing. Firestore rules properly secure user task isolation.

### Finance (`src/app/dashboard/finance/*`)
- Hook centralizes fetch, memoized derivations, and cost mutations; components render modular sections (stats, charts, invoices, upcoming payments). Skeleton handles initial load gracefully.
- API `GET /api/finance` aggregates revenue, invoices, costs with simple filtering; `POST/DELETE /api/finance/costs` requires admin role.
- Observed gap: `selectedPeriod` currently affects UI helper text only; backend ignores period filtering.

### Proposals (`src/app/dashboard/proposals/page.tsx`)
- Wizard merges form state via `mergeProposalForm`, autosave flows (via `services/proposals.ts`), and submission triggers Gemini summary + Gamma PPT storage. History view surfaces `pptUrl` + Gamma share links.
- API `submit` route handles summarization errors gracefully, preserving previous deck URLs if storage fails. Consider rate limiting / idempotency for repeated submissions.

### Collaboration (`src/app/dashboard/collaboration/*`)
- Channel list, message pane, and sidebar modularized; session token cache reduces repeated `getIdToken` calls, storing tokens in cookies for reuse.
- **Real-time implemented**: Added Firestore listeners for live message updates via `use-collaboration-data.ts` with proper cleanup and error handling.
- Messaging endpoints under `api/collaboration/messages` validated with comprehensive zod schemas; real-time subscriptions complement REST API.

### Settings & Billing (`src/app/settings/page.tsx`)
- Profile update form now edits name/phone with validation and toasts.
- Billing section expects `/api/billing/*` routes to return Stripe plan/subscription data; requires environment setup. README states Stripe payments operational, but code depends on yet-to-be-verified backend logic.

### Chatbot (`components/chatbot.tsx`, `services/chatbot.ts`)
- Chat widget shells Gemini responses into JSON instructions for suggestions/actions. Error handling provides fallback text. No server-side conversation storage; purely session-based.

### Admin Section (`src/app/admin/*`)
- Basic admin pages for users, clients, leads, team management exist.
- Uses same auth patterns as main app, limited admin-specific functionality.
- No bulk operations, advanced reporting, or admin-specific workflows.

## Security & Compliance Observations
- **Auth verification**: `authenticateRequest` calls Google Identity Toolkit for each request. Works but incurs latency and quota; consider caching decoded tokens or switching to Admin SDK `verifyIdToken` for efficiency.
- **Admin gating**: `assertAdmin` falls back to `ADMIN_EMAILS` list if custom claim absent. Ensure env configured; otherwise cost mutations inaccessible.
- **Firestore rules**: ✅ **All collections properly secured** with user isolation, admin controls, and appropriate read/write permissions.
- **Storage rules**: Strengthened to enforce owner uploads with type/size checks (`storage.rules`). Comprehensive file protection implemented.
- **Secrets**: Multiple env vars (Gamma, Gemini, Stripe, Firebase Admin) required; `.env.local.example` referenced in README but missing.
- **Cron access**: APIs support `INTEGRATIONS_CRON_SECRET`, yet no background worker included. Documented but unimplemented.

## Documentation, DX, & Tooling
- README overstates functionality (Stripe payments, real-time chat, jsPDF) and references non-existent `.env.local.example`. Needs alignment with current stack (Gamma PPTX, token caching, etc.).
- Dependencies include unused packages (e.g., `socket.io`, `jspdf`, `axios`), increasing bundle size risk; audit `package.json`.
- No testing framework configured (no Jest/Vitest/Playwright). `npm run lint` is only quality gate.
- Lack of scripts for seeding Firestore or running cron jobs; onboarding requires additional guidance.
- Missing CI/CD pipeline, Docker configuration, and deployment automation.

## Testing & Observability
- Unit/integration tests absent across modules. Hooks/services interacting with Firestore and AI lack mocks or contract tests.
- No logging/monitoring beyond `console.error`. Consider structured logging and error reporting (e.g., Sentry) before production rollout.
- Edge cases (AI failures, missing env vars, large uploads) partially handled with toasts but not covered by automated tests.
- No performance monitoring, A/B testing framework, or analytics tracking.
- No health checks or uptime monitoring for API endpoints.

## Production Readiness Assessment
| Category | Score | Key Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Code Quality** | 7/10 | Good TypeScript usage, modular components, but missing tests |
| **Security** | 8/10 | Strong auth and rules, but token verification could be optimized |
| **Performance** | 6/10 | Basic caching, no optimization for large datasets |
| **Scalability** | 5/10 | No pagination, background jobs, or horizontal scaling considerations |
| **Monitoring** | 3/10 | Basic error logging only |
| **Documentation** | 5/10 | Good internal docs, but README misaligned with reality |
| **Deployment** | 4/10 | Manual deployment only, no automation |
| **Overall** | 6/10 | Functional prototype requiring production hardening |

## Production Readiness Scorecard (Updated)
| Category | Score | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Features** | 9/10 | All primary dashboards functional; AI integrations working; real-time collaboration implemented |
| **Security** | 9/10 | ✅ All Firestore rules properly configured; storage rules comprehensive; auth and admin controls solid |
| **Performance** | 6/10 | No caching strategy; repeated auth lookups; missing query indexes for optimization |
| **Testing** | 2/10 | No automated tests; manual testing only |
| **Documentation** | 5/10 | Good high-level overview; missing env setup and API docs |
| **Deployment** | 4/10 | Basic Next.js config; no CI/CD, Docker, or production scripts |
| **Monitoring** | 3/10 | Basic console.error; no structured logging or alerts |
| **Overall** | **7/10** | Strong security and feature foundation; needs production tooling and optimization |

## Risks & Gaps
- **AI/External dependency resilience**: Gamma/Gemini failures degrade gracefully but there is no retry/backoff or user re-queue mechanism.
- **Data freshness**: Analytics relies on external sync jobs not present in repo; without them dashboards will stay empty.
- **Auth token reuse**: Collaboration cookie cache stores raw Firebase token client-side; ensure token TTL respected and refresh triggered before expiry.
- **Billing flows**: Stripe endpoints must be validated; absence of webhook handling implies manual reconciliation.
- **Docs drift**: README promises features not currently backed by code; can mislead stakeholders.
- **Scalability**: No pagination, rate limiting, or caching strategies for production scale.
- **Compliance**: No audit logging, data retention policies, or GDPR considerations.
